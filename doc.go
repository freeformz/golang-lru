// Package lru provides three different LRU caches of varying sophistication.
//
// Cache is a simple LRU cache. It is based on the LRU implementation in
// groupcache: https://github.com/golang/groupcache/tree/master/lru
//
// TwoQueueCache tracks frequently used and recently used entries separately.
// This avoids a burst of accesses from taking out frequently used entries, at
// the cost of about 2x computational overhead and some extra bookkeeping.
//
// All caches in this package take locks while operating, and are therefore
// thread-safe for consumers.
